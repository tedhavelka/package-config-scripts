// SECTION:  installer script implemtation details
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

Packages assigned to script variables within the script are becoming cumbersome to update.  Ted wants to move the post-install packages list out of the script to a separate, multi-field file.  In this case multi-field is synonymous with multi-column.  Lines of the post-install packages list file will contain package names, category for package, indicator of distribution of which package is a part or member, and other notes.
